      A bed sheet can speak volumes about your personality and your taste in home décor. A bed sheet transforms the look of a bedroom in a beautiful way. They are made of various fabrics, such as cotton, linen, synthetics, and silk. History says that the first bed sheets were made of linen, which was derived from the flax plant.

  1. At first, you need to consider the size of your bed. Measure your mattress and see if you need a king, single or double bed sheet. When you are buying cotton sheets, make sure to buy a bigger size as cotton shrinks with every wash. You should also invest in good quality <b>comforters</b> for your bedding.<br><br>
